            <h2>The Ferocius Chedipe</h2>
            <p>The chedipe is described as a witch-vampire in the folklore of the region around the Godavari River in India.They are associated with the betals,women who die an unnatural death,such as in childbirth or suicideandprostitutes may become chedipes.chedipes are characterized as being undead.</p>
			<p>The chedipe is described as a vulgur woman riding on a tiger in the moonlit night.The typical chedipe story carries out with them choosing a house and magically forcing the closed doors of the house open, to which she enters naked. She casts a spell on the residents of the home, putting them in a deep sleep. She then sucks the blood of all of the men in the house through their toes. Some traditions say that she feasts only on the strongest man of the house. Others suggest that the chedipe targets only the man whom she dislikes. In the morning, the victim of the chedipe will awaken from their sleep with no memory of the chedipe's visit. He will be sapped of his virility and will feel uneasy and slightly intoxicated for the entirety of the following day. If he does not receive medical treatment, the chedipe will return.

            <h2>The Tale of Murasaki</h2>
            <p>The Tale of Murasaki is written in the form of a memoir by Lady Murasaki, a member of the Heian court at Miyako (now Kyoto) and author of the world-famous Tale Of Genji. Author/anthropologist Liza Dalby, who specializes in Japanese culture, has included excerpts from Murasaki’s thousand-year-old diary and most of her brief, oblique poems, through which educated folk traditionally communicated.</p>
			<p>Dalby, the only Western woman ever to become a geisha, presents a fascinating view of medieval Japan, where the residence chambers of the Imperial Palace contain no lavatories, and smallpox rages unchecked in summer months. Still, fashionable women seductively blacken their teeth while courtiers ink spontaneous poems to display their wit or longing. This book is filled with small delights, including the brilliance of court robes, bilingual poetry, and endpapers in the rich purple known as murasaki.Although Murasaki has been educated, her views are broadened by exposure to life beyond the capital, especially through contact with visitors from China. (Young Murasaki wonders whether fireflies are truly the lingering souls of dead babies, as she has been taught, or born of the rotting vegetation of summer, as the Chinese believe.) Eventually she returns to Miyako, marriage, and life as a lady-in-waiting to the Empress. Her growing awareness is mirrored in the stories of Prince Genji that she writes to amuse herself and others.

            <h2>Pecos Bill the Coyotes</h2>
            <p>Pecos Bill a fictional cowboy and folk hero in stories set during American westward expansion into the Southwest of Texas, New Mexico, Southern California, and Arizona. These narratives were invented as short stories in a book by Tex O'Reilly in the early 20th century and are an example of American folklore. Pecos Bill was a late addition to the "big man" idea of characters, such as Paul Bunyan or John Henry.</p>
			<p>Pecos Bill was also the nickname of Civil War general William Shafter, although this was before O'Reilly created the legend. Shafter was considered a hero in Texas, and even had some legendary poetry written about how tough he was.According to legend, Pecos Bill is responsible for creating many landmarks. One landmark he is said to have created is the Gulf of Mexico. Apparently, there was a drought in Texas that was so horrible, that Pecos rushed to California and lassoed up a storm cloud and brought it to Texas. It rained so much that the Gulf of Mexico was created. Another story is of him creating the Rio Grande River. He and his horse got stranded in the desert and needed water.</p>

            <h2>One Thousand and One Nights </h2>
            <p>One Thousand and One Nights  is a collection of Middle Eastern folktales compiled in the Arabic language during the Islamic Golden Age. It is often known in English as the Arabian Nights, from the first English-language edition , which rendered the title as The Arabian Nights' Entertainment.</p>
            <p>The main frame story concerns Shahryār whom the narrator calls a "Sasanian king" ruling in "India and China".[8] Shahryār is shocked to learn that his brother's wife is unfaithful. Discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahryār begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him.

Eventually the Vizier (Wazir), whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade, the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.</p>

            <h2>Pide Piper of Hamelin </h2>
            <p>The Pied Piper of Hamelin  is the title character of a legend from the town of Hamelin (Hameln), Lower Saxony, Germany.There are many contradictory theories about the Pied Piper. Some suggest he was a symbol of hope to the people of Hamelin, which had been attacked by plague; he drove the rats from Hamelin, saving the people from the epidemic.[3]</p>
            <p>In 1284, while the town of Hamelin was suffering from a rat infestation, a piper dressed in multicolored  clothing appeared, claiming to be a rat-catcher. He promised the mayor a solution to their problem with the rats. The mayor, in turn, promised to pay him for the removal of the rats . The piper accepted and played his pipe to lure the rats into the Weser River, where all the rats drowned.

Despite the piper's success, the mayor reneged on his promise and refused to pay him the full sum even going so far as to blame the piper for bringing the rats himself in an extortion attempt. Enraged, the piper stormed out of the town, vowing to return later to take revenge. On Saint John and Paul's day, while the adults were in church, the piper returned, dressed in green like a hunter and playing his pipe. In so doing, he attracted the town's children. One hundred and thirty children followed him out of town and into a cave, after which they were never seen again. </p>

            <h2> Lucy at the Sea </h2>
            <p>Elizabeth Strout’s newest novel, Lucy by the Sea, achieves this goal imperfectly but beautifully. Strout is among the great living American writers, known for prose that is the literary equivalent of Shaker furniture: so elegant and sturdy that, though Strout frequently engages with current events, her writing often seems entirely detached from contemporary literary trends. This is not true of Lucy by the Sea, if only because it comes as part of the first trickle of COVID-centric novels. It takes place during the first year of the pandemic, which Strout evokes in such careful detail that the book can feel like a time capsule.</p>
            <p>During the spring of 2020, I found myself thinking a lot about the fact that I was living through a historic disaster. I read about past wars and crises, trying to calm myself with the knowledge that prior generations had been through worse. I can see now that I was distracting myself from my own day-to-day. I’d just rescued a dog who cried in the night and was frightened of people she didn’t know, and my neighbor was a dealer whose clients liked to linger in the hallway without masks. When I think about the early pandemic now, it takes effort not to conjure the memories that everyone I know shares—stockpiling beans, improvising face coverings, wiping down the light switches with bleach—and to remember, instead, how much time I spent in those months trying to soothe my dog while she barked at maskless strangers in my building.


Ignoring the idiosyncrasies of our daily experiences is startlingly easy. Modern online life, with its flattening megaphone, encourages us to process personal chaos in terms of societal pain. Fiction, at its best, is an antidote to that impulse. Even sweeping, multi-protagonist novels can illuminate the fine details of their characters’ worlds, throwing them into relief against the broader background of collective social experience. By focusing on the mundane and minor quirks of individual lives, fiction can, paradoxically, encourage readers to recall momentous and dramatic events, with the clarity those events deserve. What better form than the novel, then, to help us remember the first stages of the pandemic anew, rather than avert our eyes in retrospect.</p>

            <h2>BEOWULF</h2>
            <p>Beowulf  is an Old English epic poem in the tradition of Germanic heroic legend consisting of 3,182 alliterative lines. It is one of the most important and most often translated works of Old English literature. The date of composition is a matter of contention among scholars; the only certain dating is for the manuscript, which was produced between 975 and 1025. Scholars call the anonymous author the "Beowulf poet".</p>
            <p>The story is set in pagan Scandinavia in the 6th century. Beowulf, a hero of the Geats, comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, whose mead hall in Heorot has been under attack by the monster Grendel. After Beowulf slays him, Grendel's mother attacks the hall and is then defeated. Victorious, Beowulf goes home to Geatland and becomes king of the Geats. Fifty years later, Beowulf defeats a dragon, but is mortally wounded in the battle. After his death, his attendants cremate his body and erect a barrow on a headland in his memory.

Scholars have debated whether Beowulf was transmitted orally, affecting its interpretation: if it was composed early, in pagan times, then the paganism is central and the Christian elements were added later, whereas if it was composed later, in writing, by a Christian, then the pagan elements could be decorative archaising; some scholars also hold an intermediate position. Beowulf is written mostly in the Late West Saxon dialect of Old English, but many other dialectal forms are present, suggesting that the poem may have had a long and complex transmission throughout the dialect areas of England.</p>
